# Quick Fix for OAuth Authentication

## Status: OAuth Not Configured ⚠️

The Google and Microsoft authentication buttons are currently not functional because OAuth providers haven't been configured in the Supabase dashboard.

## Current Workaround ✅

**Email/Password authentication is fully functional and working correctly.**

Users can:

- Sign up with email and password
- Login with email and password
- Access all features of the Smart Inventory System

## What's Been Fixed

1. **Added Error Handling**: OAuth buttons now show helpful error messages when clicked
2. **User Feedback**: Clear messaging that OAuth needs configuration
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Email/password auth continues to work perfectly

## For Production Use

To enable Google and Microsoft authentication, follow the `OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md`:

1. Configure OAuth providers in Supabase dashboard
2. Set up Google Cloud Console credentials
3. Set up Microsoft Azure AD credentials
4. Test the OAuth flow

## Testing

✅ **Email/Password Login**: Works perfectly
✅ **Email/Password Signup**: Works perfectly  
⚠️ **Google OAuth**: Shows configuration message
⚠️ **Microsoft OAuth**: Shows configuration message

The system is fully functional for users who prefer email/password authentication.
